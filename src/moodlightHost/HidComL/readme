How to compile:
gcc HidCom.cpp -o HidCom

Usage:
HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s 5 <red> <green> <blue> <mode> <n>
	* 03eb and 204f are the vendor and product id of your moodlight
	* <n> is the "duration (in seconds/number of blinks)"
	* "-s 5" is required to limit the "report size" - which appeares to be to long by default

Example:
	Blink red for 1 second
	HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s  6 ff 00 00 00 01
	
	Fade in green for 3 seconds
	./HidCom -v 03eb -p 204f -s 5 00 ff 00 02 03
